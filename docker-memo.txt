	> docker run -d -t <image id>
		Runs docker image making a new container for indefinite time
		Get container name by running:
			>docker ps -a
		To stop container run:
			>docker stop <container id>
		TO run container again run:
			>docker start <contaoner id>
				Container will be run with the same mode, e.g. '-d -t'

	> docker compose up -d
		Runs container through 'compose', '-d' means daemon

	> docker-build compose up -d
		Builds and run through 'compose', '-d' means daemon

If the error below appears:
	"Error response from daemon: network 0a0b68620874cb7a3a41822d9fab2e490efefcd9e789a0ff881fc6df8c5a9301 not found"
	try to run a command: 
		> docker-compose up --force-recreate
	got it from here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39640963/error-response-from-daemon-network-myapp-not-found

If occationally docker daemon is not running this can be found by running any 'sudo docker ...' 
	stating that supposedly docker daemon is not running then first run the command:
		> sudo docker info
	If this command fails then check status of daemon running the following:
		> sudo systemctl status daemon
	If docker is not running then
		> sudo systemctl start docker
	And then check docker status by calling 
		> sudo docker info
